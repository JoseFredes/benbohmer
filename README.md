## Things To Do

Here are some improvements that could be made in the future:

1. **Switch to TypeScript**: Due to time constraints, the project is currently written in JavaScript. Converting to TypeScript could provide more robust type checking and could help catch potential bugs earlier.

2. **Create a modular table component**: The current implementation has separate components for different tables. By creating a single table component that is customizable, we could reduce code duplication and increase the flexibility of our table displays.

3. **Refactor TODOs**: There are some TODO comments left in the code that need to be addressed. This could involve fixing minor bugs, optimizing code, or implementing new features.

4. **Improve front-end styling**: The current UI could use some improvements in terms of its aesthetic appeal. This could involve changing the color scheme, adjusting layouts, or creating new UI elements.

5. **Fix table selection behavior**: Currently, the selector of the first table remains selected when continuing to assign invoices. This behavior should be modified so that the selector does not stay selected.

6. **Add typings for useState**: The useState hooks currently lack typings. Adding typings would provide stronger type checking and increase the robustness of the code.

7. **Improve button and table behavior**: The behavior of buttons and tables could be better managed. This could involve tweaking interaction effects, changing how data is loaded and displayed, or refining the user experience in other ways.

8. **Consider adding alerts**: Alerts could be used to provide immediate feedback to users or to handle errors more gracefully.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
